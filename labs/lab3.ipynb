    "A babysitter charges $15.00 an hour until 9:00 PM when the rate drops to $12.00 an hour (the children are in bed). Write a Function named \"calculate_babysitting_bill\" with the follwing function signature \"calculate_babysitting_bill(start_time, end_time)\" that accepts a starting time and ending time in hours and minutes and calculates the total babysitting bill. You may assume that the starting and ending times are entered as text in the following format:  \"HH:MM\", eg 6:30 PM would be entered as \"18:30\" and 1:30 AM would be entered as \"01:30\". Partial hours should be appropriately prorated.  The total bill should be rounded to the second decimal position.  Use the following print statement for the output of the function:\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f'The total babysitting bill is: ${total_bill:,.2f}.')\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that the end_time babysitting will not be later than 03:00 (ie 3 AM).  You do not need to have your function check to see if the end_time is later than 03:00.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: you may use \"datetime\" and \"timedelta\" from the \"datetime\" library.\n",
